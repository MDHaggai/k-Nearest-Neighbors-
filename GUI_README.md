#### Confidence Score
- **90-100%**: Very high confidence in the result
- **80-89%**: High confidence
- **70-79%**: Moderate confidence
- **Below 70%**: Low confidence - manual verification recommended

#### Extracted Features
The system analyzes four key features from the banknote image:

1. **Variance**: Measure of texture variation in wavelet coefficients
2. **Skewness**: Asymmetry of the wavelet coefficient distribution
3. **Kurtosis**: Tail heaviness of the distribution
4. **Entropy**: Information content and randomness measure

CARD_COLOR = '#313244'          # Card backgrounds
TEXT_COLOR = '#cdd6f4'          # Primary text
ACCENT_COLOR = '#89b4f0'        # Accent elements
```

### Adjusting Model Parameters

Modify the model configuration:

```python
# In load_model() method
self.model = KNeighborsClassifier(
    n_neighbors=5,        # Number of neighbors
    metric='euclidean',   # Distance metric
    weights='uniform'     # Weighting scheme
)
```

- Ensure the image file is not corrupted
- Check that the file format is supported (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF)
- Verify the file path doesn't contain special characters

**‚ùå GUI appears too small/large**
- Adjust the window size in `setup_window()` method
- Modify the DPI scaling settings in your OS
